# Problem 1

The purpose of this problem is to examine a few data types/classes in R for homework 1.

```{r}
example_df = tibble(
  normal = rnorm(8),
  normal_pos = normal > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Lisa", "Danielle", "Eisler", "MD", "MS"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("A", "B", "C", "C", "B", "A", "B", "C"))
)
```

The mean of the numeric variable is `r mean(pull(example_df, normal))`.

The mean of the logical variable is `r mean(pull(example_df, normal_pos))`.

The mean of the character variable is `r mean(pull(example_df, vec_char))`.

The mean of the factor variable is `r mean(pull(example_df, vec_char))`.
